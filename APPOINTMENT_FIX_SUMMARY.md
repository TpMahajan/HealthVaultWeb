- âœ… **Functional**: Endpoint exists and processes requests

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Use:**

Both appointment creation methods are now fully functional:

The appointment system should now work without the "Error creating appointment. Please try again." message, and both scheduling options are properly enabled and functional.
